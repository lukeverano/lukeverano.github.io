## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1
  I believe I have to put this here because this was the very first ever time I coded on a laptop. This lab started the class and our journey as beginner coders.

* Lab 7, Part 2
  This lab was one of the most memorable labs out of all of the work because of how difficult I thought it was. We implemented input and output into this lab and brought in real-life situations.

* Lab 6, Part 1
  This lab was my favorite to do, working on shell commands was fun. Also, learning about how to use element and index about the sandwich was simple in the lectures
